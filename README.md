# DCS-on-Linux
a set of tools, known issues (and workarounds), as well as other locations to get the best, up to date, advice for running dcs on linux, in an attempt to defragment the whole experience

# INSTALLING
please follow along with our [guides](https://github.com/ChaosRifle/DCS-on-Linux/wiki/Installation#select-an-installation-method) as DCS has many issues and the guides are there to mitigate the problems, both with DCS, and the installation method itself sometimes

# CONTRIBUTING
This is meant to be a community hub (and eventually wiki) for the current best ways and tools to use to install DCS on linux. as such, as new information comes to light, please let a maintainer know, or make a PR to the repo. If the lutris installer needs an update, please make a PR to the yaml script contained here, as I(chaos) will use that to edit and maintain the current script on lutris.net



## Where to get guides/help - a list of all the recommended information currently available (@ me or make a PR if you find something useful!)
- Budderpards [guide](https://github.com/budderpard/DCS_Standalone_on_linux/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file)
- live chat [matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#dcs-on-linux:matrix.org) community if this page or the above guide does not work

old resources that contain a lot of outdated information, but may be of use for extended troubleshooting in edge cases. In order of how dated the information is:
- Deleterium's [updated](https://github.com/deleterium/dcs_on_linux) version of zoq2's guide
- proton [issues](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/1722) if you are in a pinch, a pain to search but occasionally useful
- hoggit [wiki](https://wiki.hoggitworld.com/view/DCS_on_linux)
