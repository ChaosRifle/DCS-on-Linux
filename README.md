# DCS-on-Linux
- a set of tools, known issues (and workarounds), as well as other locations to get the best, up to date, advice for running dcs on linux, in an attempt to defragment the whole experience
- **If you have any questions this repo did not explain or link to a source on, *please*, open an issue / go to the matrix server and ping(@) a contributer, and *ask the question while also noting that the repo did not explain it!*** 
- If you had a problem, please report it! you are helping others by doing so, somebody else probably had the same issue too. Thank you!




# INSTALLING AND TROUBLESHOOTING
please [follow along with our wiki / guides](https://github.com/ChaosRifle/DCS-on-Linux/wiki), and select an installation method. DCS has many issues and the guides are there to mitigate the current known issues, both with DCS, and the installation method itself sometimes. This link also provides troubleshooting pages.



# CONTRIBUTING
This is meant to be a community hub (and eventually wiki) for the current best ways and tools to use to install DCS on linux - as such, when new information comes to light, ***please let a maintainer know, or make a PR to the repo***. If the lutris installer needs an update, please make a PR to the yaml script contained here or ping Chaos, as I(chaos) will use this yaml to edit and maintain the current script on lutris.net (``DoL Community Choice (Latest)``)
### guidelines
- linking: mentions of locations on the wiki should always link to said location. usage of terminology or abreviations should follow wikipedia standards of the first occurance linking to the relevent terminology page
- troubleshooting sections: all problems will be encased in a note block. All notes must be date-stamped for the day that became an issue (yyyy/mm/dd). Old problems will be grandfathered in under "date unknown" due to the work involved for minimal gains, however, going forward new problems should require it where feesable.
