# DCS on Linux
- a set of tools, known issues (and workarounds), as well as other locations to get the best, up to date, advice for running DCS on linux, in an attempt to defragment the whole experience
- **If you have any questions this repo did not explain or link to a source on, *please*, open an issue / go to the matrix server and ping(@) a contributer, and *ask the question while also noting that the repo did not explain it!*** 
- If you had a problem, please report it! you are helping others by doing so, somebody else probably had the same issue too. Thank you!




# INSTALLING AND TROUBLESHOOTING
please [follow along with our wiki / guides](https://github.com/ChaosRifle/DCS-on-Linux/wiki), and select an installation method. DCS has many issues and the guides are there to mitigate the current known issues, both with DCS, and the installation method itself sometimes. This link also provides troubleshooting pages.
