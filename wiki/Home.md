### Recommended Distros
* good picks are, but not limited to, Fedora, Arch, Ubuntu, or derivitives like Nobara, Endeavour, Kubuntu. Anything NOT falling into the not-recommended list below

### NOT recommended Distros
* Anything NOT hyper-gamer with kernel tweaks or promising better gaming performance - distros with kernel mods introduce more microstutters than they fix and are often one man projects that get abandoned. They tend to deliver little to no average fps gains, and worse .1% lows. While its true in some limited games they get marginally better performance, they get worse regressions in other games, making them generally not worth using on average. You will get better performance gains from new versions of Wine or DXVK
* anything NOT [LTS](https://github.com/ChaosRifle/DCS-on-Linux/wiki/Knowledge-Base#lts-long-term-support) - LTS means old packages, and old packages means sometimes not compatible with new game updates
