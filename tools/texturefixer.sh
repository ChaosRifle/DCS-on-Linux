# documentation/explanation

# texturefixer.sh repairs ED's faulty textures - dependency of ImageMagick (usually pre-installed in most distro)

# this script breaks Integrity Check for Textures, if you fly that aircraft. IC sounds scary but all it does is prevent
# you from joining servers blocking that type, if already broken, or kick you to menu if you break it on-server.
# there are zero punishments for breaking IC, it is just there to keep files normal. restart your game client
# and you will be able to rejoin just fine. if you want to fly that aircraft on IC servers, uninstall your mods and 
# repair the game files, then reinstall your mods

# This works by re-saving the files. This means any time you update/repair the game, you must run the script
# Long story, ED screwed up and got off-by-one's in some, others.. we're not really sure why it fixes those, but it does




# ensure our scripts are never run as root
